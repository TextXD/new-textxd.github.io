**TextXD** aims to:

- Foster a cross-disciplinary community of text processing experts
  from academia, research, and industry.
- Develop a shared understanding of each other's use of text
  processing data, algorithms, and software.
- Help us learn from one another, through tutorials, and collaborative work
  sessions, about available tools and methods, and the applicability
  of these to various discipline-specific problems.

Our [annual symposium](/textxd2018/) is our main avenue
for achieving these aims.
